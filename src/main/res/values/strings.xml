        This is the result of a personal project fruit of research and analysis, in which all the tools that might be needed to accurately predict what dose of insulin administered in a given meal are implemented.<br/><br/>

    <string name="help_fragment_main_3_modifiers">Later, are applied the active Metabolic Rhythm modifiers. You can define how the doses will be modified over time since the Metabolic Rhythm activation, and/or you can define modifiers that meet specific changes when walking, running, etc (Correctives)</string>
    <string name="help_fragment_main_3_modifiers_2">And at the end, the Correction Factor modification if activated and if your glucose level have to be corrected</string>
    <string name="help_fragment_main_3_basal_1">The basal part of the recommendation, if you are using it in Cafydia, is more simple. Begins with the fixed value entered by hand by you for breakfast, lunch, or dinner in the Baseline menu</string>
    <string name="help_fragment_main_3_basal_2">And at the end, are applied the Basal Beginnings of the Metabolic Rhythm activated</string>
